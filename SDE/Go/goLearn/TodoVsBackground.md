In Go, the `context` package provides a way to pass cancellation signals, deadlines, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes. Two common functions provided by this package to create a new context are `context.Background()` and `context.TODO()`. Although they both return an empty context, they are intended for different use cases.

### `context.Background()`

`context.Background()` is intended to be used when you need a context and you are certain that it won't be canceled, won't have a deadline, and you don't need to pass any values. It is typically used as the top-level context in your main function, initialization, or in tests.

Example usage:
```go
func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    db, err := mongo.Connect(ctx, options.Client().ApplyURI("your-mongo-uri"))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // Use db with ctx
}
```

### `context.TODO()`

`context.TODO()` is intended to be used when you're not sure which context to use or when you haven't decided whether the context will be canceled, have a deadline, or carry values. It is a placeholder that indicates that you need to consider what context to use in the future.

Example usage:
```go
func someFunction() {
    ctx := context.TODO()
    db, err := mongo.Connect(ctx, options.Client().ApplyURI("your-mongo-uri"))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // Use db with ctx
}
```

### Key Differences

- **Intention**: 
  - `context.Background()` is used when you are sure the context is not cancelable, does not have a deadline, and does not carry values. It's for top-level contexts.
  - `context.TODO()` is a marker to indicate that you need to decide what context to use later. Itâ€™s a temporary placeholder.

- **Use Case**:
  - Use `context.Background()` in main functions, initialization, and tests when you don't need to derive other contexts.
  - Use `context.TODO()` in places where context management hasn't been fully implemented or when you're refactoring code and will revisit the context usage later.

### Practical Implications

- **Readability**: Using `context.TODO()` can make it clear to other developers (or your future self) that the context usage needs further consideration.
- **Code Quality**: Using `context.Background()` appropriately ensures that your code reflects the intended context usage correctly, aiding in proper context propagation and cancellation handling.

In summary, use `context.Background()` when you are certain of the context's scope and use `context.TODO()` as a temporary placeholder that indicates further context handling is required.
