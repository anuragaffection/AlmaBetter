Parallelism and concurrency are two terms that often create confusion. 
-- One is about managing multiple tasks at once, intermixing them to optimize resource usage. 
-- The other involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously, typically on multiple processors or cores. 

As Rob Pyke (one of the creators of GoLang) succinctly put it:
-- 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 is about 𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 lots of things at once. 
-- 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗺  is about 𝐝𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠  lots of things at once.


𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆? 
-- Managing several tasks on a single processor by intermixing them, giving the appearance of simultaneous execution is called concurrency. 
-- It refers to the system's ability to switch between multiple tasks rather than performing them at once, creating an illusion of parallel execution. 
-- Concurrency effectively utilizes processor time, especially when tasks must wait for others to finish. 

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗺? 
-- Parallelism involves performing multiple tasks simultaneously. 
-- This works by efficiently utilizing multiple processors or cores in a computing system. 
-- The distinction between concurrency and parallelism has a direct impact on application performance and efficiency. 
-- Because it supports simultaneous task execution, parallelism is particularly useful for compute-intensive applications that distribute tasks across multiple processors.

Understanding concurrency and parallelism is an important distinction for building high-performing and efficient software solutions.
