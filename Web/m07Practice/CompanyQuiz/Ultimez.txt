React's Context API with useContext






08.
Which of the following statements is true regarding the await keyword in JavaScript?

It can only be used inside synchronous functions

It can be used to pause the execution of a synchronous function.

It is used to handle asynchronous operations and pause the execution of an async function until the awaited operation is complete.

It is only used in older versions of JavaScript

Which JavaScript feature can be used to handle multiple asynchronous operations concurrently and collect their results?

Promises

Callbacks

Event Listeners

11.
What is the purpose of the combineReducers function in Redux?

To combine multiple Redux stores into one

12.
What is Redux used for in a React application?

13.
What is a callback hell or pyramid of doom?

A pattern for writing synchronous code that is easy to read and maintain.

A pattern for writing asynchronous code that avoids nested callbacks.

A situation where multiple asynchronous operations are nested inside one another, creating a difficult-to- read and maintain code structure.

A naming convention for functions used in asynchronous code.





14.
What is the key difference between props and state in React?

Props are immutable, while state is mutable

Props are used for data that doesn't change, while state is used for dynamic data

Props are accessible only in functional components, while state is used in class components

Props can be modified directly, while state should be updated using the setState method







15.
What is the purpose of the try...catch block in asynchronous code?

It is used to create custom error messages.

It is used to define a synchronous function.

It is used to handle and manage errors that occur during the execution of asynchronous code.

To define component methods





17.
What is the primary difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions?

Synchronous functions return promises, while asynchronous functions do not.

Synchronous functions block the event loop, while asynchronous functions do not.

Synchronous functions always execute faster than asynchronous functions.

Synchronous functions are only used in single- threaded applications.

It maps state values to props for a connected component

It defines the initial state of the Redux store

It dispatches actions to the Redux store

It specifies how actions should be handled in the component





21.
What is prop drilling in the context of React?

A technique to pass data from child components to parent components.

A method to access the React context API.

A way to optimize rendering in functional components.

A pattern for managing state in class components.






22.
Which middleware is commonly used in Redux for handling asynchronous actions?

Redux Thunk

Redux Saga

Redux Logger

Redux Router






23.
How can you overcome prop drilling in React?

Use the useState hook to manage state locally in each component

Use the useState hook to manage state locally in each component

Use the context API to provide data globally to all components

Use the context API to provide data globally to all components





24.
How can you overcome prop drilling in React?

Use the useState hook to manage state locally in each component

Use the useState hook to manage state locally in each component

Use the context API to provide data globally to all components

Use the context API to provide data globally to all components






25.
In a large React application, what are some strategies for reducing the negative impact of prop drilling?

Use the props object directly in all components to minimize nesting.

Break down your components into smaller, more focused pieces.

Always use Redux for state management to eliminate prop drilling.

Avoid using props altogether and rely on global variables
