Answer


01.
GET

The GET method is used for safe and idempotent read-only operations in a RESTful API. It is intended for retrieving data without causing any side effects on the server.





02.
It is used to create a reference to a DOM element or a child component.

Forward refs allow a parent component to access the DOM element or a child component's instance. It's often used for managing focus, triggering imperative animations, or interacting with third-party libraries.






03.
HTTP/HTTPS

HTTP/HTTPS is commonly used for inter-service communication in microservices due to its widespread support for RESTful APIs.






04.
Handles asynchronous operations and callbacks

The Event Loop in Node.js is responsible for managing asynchronous operations and callbacks. It ensures that non-blocking I/O operations are processed efficiently.







05.
Consistent deployment and isolation

Containerization technologies like Docker provide consistent deployment environments and isolation for microservices, which helps in managing complex architectures.







06.
To ensure backward compatibility.

Versioning in API design is essential to maintain backward compatibility with existing clients while introducing changes or updates to the API. This helps prevent breaking existing client applications and ensures a smoother transition to new versions.







07.
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

SOAP is not a RESTful constraint; it's a different protocol for building web services. The other options (A, B, D) are principles and constraints associated with RESTful APIs.









08.
To convert callback-based functions into Promises

The 'util.promisify' function in Node.js is used to convert functions that use callbacks into functions that return Promises, making it easier to work with asynchronous code.







09.
Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing is a technique used to maintain data consistency in a microservices environment by storing all changes as a sequence of events.








10.
It is used to insert raw HTML into a component, potentially introducing a security risk.

dangerouslySetInnerHTML allows you to inject HTML directly into a component, but it should be used with caution as it can expose your application to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.







11.
Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle suggests that microservices should have a single, well-defined responsibility or function.






12.
Independent data storage

Well-designed microservices have independent data storage to avoid data coupling and maintain encapsulation.







13.
It is used to determine if a component should re-render when its state or props change.

The shouldComponentUpdate method is called before a component re-renders and allows you to control whether the component should re-render based on the changes in its state or props. This can be used for performance optimization.






14.
Use of distributed transactions

Ensuring data consistency in a microservices architecture can be challenging due to the avoidance of distributed transactions, which can lead to eventual consistency problems.






15.
Complex inter-service communication

Microservices can introduce complexity in inter-service communication, as services need to interact with each other through APIs, which can be challenging to manage.









16.
To choose the format or representation of the response data.

Content Negotiation allows clients and servers to agree on the format (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML) of the response data, ensuring that clients receive the data in a format they can process.









17.
201 Created

HTTP status code 201 indicates that a new resource has been successfully created in the API. It is the appropriate status code to use in this context.






18.
A situation where multiple nested callbacks make the code unreadable and hard to maintain

Callback hell refers to the problem of having too many nested callbacks in your code, making it difficult to read and maintain. This issue can be mitigated using techniques like Promises or async/await.








19.
A function with access to its own scope, as well as the outer (enclosing) function's scope

In Node.js and JavaScript, a closure is a function that has access to its own scope and the outer function's scope. This allows variables from the outer function to be accessible within the inner function.





20.
Use the connect function from the react-redux library.

The connect function is used to connect a React component to the Redux store, allowing the component to access the store's state and dispatch actions.



21.
To handle binary data directly

The 'Buffer' class in Node.js is used to work with binary data directly, allowing you to read, write, and manipulate raw data.








22.
To prevent abuse and protect server resources.

Rate limiting is used to restrict the number of API requests made by a client within a specific time frame to prevent abuse, protect server resources, and maintain service availability.








23.
To update the state by applying a reducer

The dispatch method is used to send an action to the Redux store, which in turn triggers the application of reducers to update the state.






24.
Token-based authentication

Token-based authentication can be more challenging in microservices because it requires managing and validating tokens without a shared session state.







25.
To ensure that multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request.

Idempotency in API design means that making the same request multiple times should have the same effect as making it once. This is important for ensuring predictable and safe behavior, especially for operations that may be retried.




26.
React.PureComponent only re-renders when state or props change, while React.Component re-renders on any change.

React.PureComponent performs a shallow comparison of props and state to determine whether a re-render is necessary, whereas React.Component re-renders whenever setState is called or when new props are received.






27.
To pass data down the component tree without explicitly passing props.

The context API in React allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level, making it useful for situations where data needs to be accessible by multiple components without going through intermediate components.







28.
Redux Thunk

Redux Thunk is a popular middleware for handling asynchronous actions in Redux, allowing you to dispatch functions instead of plain action objects.







29.
Service orchestration

An API Gateway can perform service orchestration by routing requests to the appropriate microservices and managing the flow of requests and responses.





30.
To update the state based on dispatched actions

A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state based on the action's type.
