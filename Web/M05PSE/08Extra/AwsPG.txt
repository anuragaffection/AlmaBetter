AWS (by Piyush Garg)


01. What is Serverless {

    Monolith
    -- We configure machine at our own 
    -- EC2 is not available in aws free tier 
    -- EC2 is expensive than AWS lambda
    -- ASG = Auto Scalling Group 

    Serverless
    -- AWS lambda = Serverless
    -- we do not have to worry about configuration of machine in serverless
    -- platform automatically manage our code 
    -- Serverless is Paas (platform as a service )
    -- AWS lambda pricing Mumbai 
    -- API Gateway 
    -- Serverless framework to manage Serverless
    -- https://www.serverless.com/framework


    Drawback of serverless
    -- it is stateless
    -- can increase the datbase const 
    -- we can not make socket connection 
    
}




02. Serverless framework with nodejs {
    -- https://www.serverless.com/framework

    Why we need Serverless framework
    -- we can not use Github Deployed code  
    -- we can not visual studio code 
}
