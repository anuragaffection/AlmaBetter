Answer


01.
To manage project boards and tasks

GitHub Projects is a feature that helps you organize and manage tasks, issues, or features using Kanban-style boards. It allows you to create custom project boards, add cards representing tasks, and track progress.





02.
To copy a repository under your GitHub account

Forking a repository on GitHub creates a copy of the original repository under your GitHub account. It allows you to freely experiment with and make changes to the repository without affecting the original project.





03.
A continuous integration and automation platform

GitHub Actions is a powerful platform for automating workflows, including continuous integration and deployment, in your GitHub repositories.





04.
Npm

Npm (Node Package Manager) is a widely used package manager for JavaScript and Node.js. It allows developers to easily install, manage, and share packages and dependencies for their JavaScript projects






05.
Reverts a commit from the branch 

Git revert undoes a specific commit by creating a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the original commit. It is a safe way to reverse the effects of a commit while preserving the commit history.




06.
All of the above

Syntax highlighting, code auto-completion, and version control integration are commonly found features in both code editors and IDEs. These features enhance productivity, code readability, and collaboration.





07.
Conflicting changes made to the same code by different developers

A merge conflict occurs when two or more developers make conflicting changes to the same code in a version control system. Conflicts arise when the system cannot automatically determine which changes to keep. Developers must resolve these conflicts manually by reviewing the conflicting code and deciding how to combine the changes.




08.
To create isolated workspaces for new features or bug fixes

Branching allows developers to create separate workspaces within a version control system. This helps isolate changes for specific features or bug fixes, allowing parallel development without interfering with the main codebase. Branches can be merged back into the main branch once the changes are complete and tested.





09.
To store and manage code

A GitHub repository is a central location where you can store and manage your code, collaborate with others, and track changes using Git.





10.
Maven

Maven is a popular package manager and build tool for Java projects. It manages dependencies and helps in building, testing, and deploying Java applications.
