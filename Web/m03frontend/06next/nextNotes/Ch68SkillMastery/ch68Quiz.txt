Answer


01.
loading

The loading property can be used to specify the loading behavior of the Image component. The available options are eager, lazy, and auto.





02.
CSS Modules are automatically enabled in Next.js without any additional setup.

Next.js has built-in support for CSS Modules, so there is no need for any additional setup or installation. You can use CSS Modules directly by naming your CSS files with the module.css extension.





03.Next.js pre-renders pages on the server-side

In client-side rendering (CSR), the content is generated on the client-side using JavaScript, which may not be as SEO-friendly. Next.js, on the other hand, pre-renders pages on the server-side, generating fully rendered HTML for each page before sending it to the client. This approach makes the content more accessible to search engine crawlers and improves SEO.




04.
A security algorithm for encrypting passwords.

Iron-Session is a session management library that provides secure cookie- based sessions for Next.js applications. It allows you to manage user sessions and store session data securely on the client-side using cookies.




05.
Yes, you can have multiple Layout components and use them on different pages as needed.

In Next.js, you can create and use multiple Layout components for different sections or pages of your application. Each page can use a different Layout component based on its specific requirements.





06.
Use the 'req.body' object.

In Next.js API routes, you can access data sent in the request body of a POST request using the 'req.body' object. To do this, you need to use the 'body- parser' middleware or the built-in 'req.body' parsing provided by Next.js.





07.
quality

The quality property can be used to specify the quality of the image in the Image component. The default value is 75.





08.
A testing framework for JavaScript applications

Cypress is a powerful end-to-end testing framework for web applications, including Next.js projects. It allows developers to write tests in JavaScript to interact with web elements and simulate user interactions.





09.
To navigate to a new page and keep the previous page in the browser history.

The push method is used to navigate to a new page and keep the previous page in the browser history. This means users can navigate back to the previous page using the browser's back button.





10.
/pages

In a Next.js project, the pages are stored in the "/pages" directory. Each file inside this directory represents a page accessible through its URL path.






11.
Using the useState hook

In Next.js functional components, you can use the useState hook from React to initialize and manage state. It allows you to add state to functional components without the need for a class.






12.
Reduced bandwidth usage

Font subsetting can lead to reduced file sizes and therefore reduced bandwidth usage.





13.
By using the getStaticProps or getServerSideProps functions to fetch metadata dynamically

In Next.js, you can add Metadata to a page dynamically by using the getStaticProps or getServerSideProps functions. These functions allow you to fetch data, including Metadata, from an external source or API and pass it as props to the page component. This approach ensures that the Metadata is up-to-date and can be generated based on the page content or data.






14.
Using caching

Using caching can help minimize API requests in Next.js





15.
Rendering content on the client side using JavaScript after the initial page load.

Client-Side Rendering (CSR) in Next.js means that the initial HTML page is sent to the client with minimal content, and the rest of the content is generated and rendered on the client side using JavaScript. After the initial page load, subsequent interactions and data fetches are handled on the client side, making the application more dynamic and interactive.





16.
To include an External Stylesheet in a Next.js component, you should use the tag with the rel attribute set to "stylesheet" and the href attribute pointing to the path of the CSS file. This way, the CSS file will be linked to the component.





17.
.CSS

In Next.js, the common file extension used for External Stylesheets is ".css". External stylesheets allow you to separate the styling from the component logic and keep your styles in a separate CSS file.





18.
useSWR is used for client-side data caching and revalidation, while getStaticProps is used for pre- rendering pages at build time.

The useSWR hook in Next.js is used for client-side data caching and revalidation, while the getStaticProps function is used for pre-rendering pages at build time. While both can be used for data fetching, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.





19.
Create a file named 404.js in the pages directory.

In Next.js, you can create a custom 404 page by creating a file named 404.js inside the pages directory. Next.js automatically recognizes this file as the custom 404 page and renders it whenever there is a 404 error.





20.
fill

The available options for the layout property in the Image component are fill, fixed, intrinsic, and responsive.





21.
By using the className attribute with the CSS class name as a string.

In Next.js, you reference CSS Modules in a component by using the className attribute and passing the CSS class name as a string. Next.js automatically generates a unique class name that maps to the corresponding CSS module.





22.
A way to pass data from one Next.js page to another through the URL.

Query parameters in Next.js are used to pass data from one page to another by appending them to the URL. They allow you to pass variables, filters, or options to a page, making it easier to share data across different pages.







23.
It can result in slower performance compared to using getStaticProps.

One of the limitations of using the getServerSideProps function in Next.js is that it can result in slower performance compared to using getStaticProps or getStaticPaths. This is because the data is fetched at runtime for each request, rather than at build time.





24.
It fetches data at build time and generates static HTML pages.

The getStaticProps function in Next.js is used to fetch data at build time and generate static HTML pages. This is useful for pages with content that doesn't change frequently, as it can improve performance and SEO.





25.
useState

The useState() hook is used to manage state within a Next.js Client Component. When the state variable changes, it triggers a re-render of the component with the updated data.





26.
All of the above

The available values for the priority property in the Image component are high, low, and auto.




27.
npx cypress open

The command npx cypress open is used to open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can see all your test files and run tests interactively.




28.
A mechanism to generate unique class names and scope styles locally in components.

CSS Modules in Next.js allow you to write CSS styles in a way that generates unique class names and scopes the styles locally within the component. This helps prevent CSS class name collisions and makes your styles more maintainable and modular.






29.
Create a folder with square brackets, like [id], inside the "pages" directory.

In Next.js, dynamic routes can be created by placing a file or folder inside the "pages" directory with square brackets, indicating the dynamic part of the URL. For example, creating a file named "[id].js" would allow you to access dynamic routes like "/posts/1" or "/posts/2".






30.
Use environment variables to store the credentials and access them in server-side code.

Storing sensitive credentials in client- side code is a security risk since it can be easily accessed and exposed. Instead, using environment variables allows you to store sensitive information outside of the codebase and access them securely on the server- side. This way, the credentials remain hidden from the client-side code and protect against potential security breaches.





31.
SWR
React Query

SWR and React Query are both tools that can be used to achieve client-side data fetching in Next.js.





32.
vercel.json

The vercel.json file is used to specify advanced deployment settings when deploying a Next.js project to Vercel. It allows developers to configure settings such as headers, redirects, and environment variables specific to the Vercel platform.






33.
They indicate that the route is a dynamic route.

In Next.js, square brackets '[ ]' are used to define dynamic routes. By placing square brackets around a part of the route, you can indicate that this part of the URL is dynamic and can receive values as query parameters.







34.
npm run build

The correct command to build a Next.js project for production deployment is npm run build. This command compiles the Next.js project and creates an optimized production build, ready to be deployed.





35.
To create a dynamic route that matches any path within the main route.

In Next.js, the [...param] syntax is used in the file name of the main route to create a catch-all route, also known as a dynamic route. It allows the main route to match any path that comes after it, and the matched path is accessible as a parameter in the component using the useRouter hook.






36.
push adds a new entry to the browser history, while replace replaces the current entry in the history.

The push method adds a new entry to the browser history, allowing users to navigate back to the previous page. On the other hand, the replace method replaces the current entry in the history with the new page, so navigating back will skip the replaced page.






37.
Rendering content on the server and sending the HTML to the client.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js refers to the process of rendering the page content on the server and sending the fully rendered HTML to the client. This ensures that the client receives a complete page with all the data pre- rendered, making it more SEO-friendly and providing better performance on the initial page load.






38.
By wrapping the entire JSX content of the page with the styled- jsx/global tag

To apply Global CSS to a Next.js page using the styled-jsx package, you need to wrap the entire JSX content of the page with the styled-jsx/global tag. This will ensure that the CSS rules are applied globally across the page.







39.
Using Next.js guarantees a top ranking on search engines.

While Next.js provides features that can significantly enhance SEO, there are many other factors that influence search engine rankings, such as content quality, backlinks, and user experience. Using Next.js alone does not guarantee a top ranking on search engines.






40.
By dynamically loading CSS styles only when they are needed.

CSS-in-JS libraries in Next.js can help improve performance by dynamically loading CSS styles only for the components that are actually used in the application. This eliminates the need to load a single large CSS file for the entire application, reducing the overall bundle size and improving loading times.
