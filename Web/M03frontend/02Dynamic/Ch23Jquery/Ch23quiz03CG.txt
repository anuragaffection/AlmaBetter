**1. What is jQuery? How does it differ from JavaScript?**

   - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies DOM manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX interactions. It provides a higher-level abstraction over native JavaScript, making it easier to write cross-browser compatible code.







**2. How do you include jQuery in a web page?**

   - You can include jQuery in a web page by including the following script tag in the HTML `<head>` or before the closing `</body>` tag:
     ```html
     <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
     ```







**3. What is the significance of the `$` symbol in jQuery?**

   - In jQuery, the `$` symbol is an alias for the jQuery object. It allows you to access jQuery methods and functions more succinctly.






**4. Explain the concept of DOM manipulation using jQuery.**

   - DOM manipulation in jQuery involves selecting HTML elements using selectors and then applying methods to manipulate their content, attributes, and styles. This can include changing text, adding/removing classes, modifying attributes, and more.






**5. How do you select elements using jQuery? Provide examples of different types of selectors.**

   - You can select elements using jQuery by using the `$` function along with CSS-style selectors. Examples:
     - Selecting an element by ID: `$("#myElement")`
     - Selecting elements by class: `$(".myClass")`
     - Selecting elements by tag: `$("div")`
     - Combining selectors: `$("div.myClass")`







**6. What are filters in jQuery? Give examples of some commonly used filters.**

   - Filters in jQuery allow you to further refine the set of selected elements. Examples:
     - `:first`, `:last`: Selects the first or last element.
     - `:even`, `:odd`: Selects even or odd elements.
     - `:visible`, `:hidden`: Selects visible or hidden elements.
     - `:not(selector)`: Excludes elements matching the selector.







**7. How can you modify the content of an HTML element using jQuery?**

   - You can modify content using methods like `text()`, `html()`, and `val()`. Example:
     ```javascript
     $("#myElement").text("New text");
     ```







**8. Explain how to add or remove classes from an element using jQuery.**

   - To add a class: `$("#myElement").addClass("newClass");`
   - To remove a class: `$("#myElement").removeClass("oldClass");`






**9. How do you create new HTML elements using jQuery? How about appending elements to existing elements?**

   - To create new elements: `var newElement = $("<div></div>");`
   - To append elements: `$("#existingElement").append(newElement);`






**10. What are jQuery events? Provide examples of commonly used events.**

    - jQuery events are actions that occur in response to user interactions or other events. Examples:
      - `click`: When an element is clicked.
      - `mouseenter`: When the mouse enters an element.
      - `submit`: When a form is submitted.





**11. How do you bind an event handler to an element using jQuery?**

     - You can use the `on()` method to bind an event handler to an element. Example:
       ```javascript
       $("#myButton").on("click", function() {
           // Event handling code
       });
       ```






**12. Explain event delegation in jQuery.**

    - Event delegation involves attaching a single event handler to a common ancestor element instead of attaching handlers to individual child elements. This helps to handle events for dynamically added elements efficiently.






**13. How do you perform AJAX requests using jQuery? Provide an example.**

    - AJAX requests are made using the `$.ajax()` function. Example:
      ```javascript
      $.ajax({
          url: "https://api.example.com/data",
          method: "GET",
          success: function(response) {
              // Handle response data
          },
          error: function(error) {
              // Handle error
          }
      });
      ```







**14. What is the purpose of the `$.ajax()` function in jQuery?**

    - The `$.ajax()` function is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to a server. It allows you to customize various aspects of the request, such as URL, method, data, headers, and more.







**15. How would you handle JSON responses from a server using jQuery?**

    - You can handle JSON responses using the `$.ajax()` `success` callback function. Example:
      ```javascript
      $.ajax({
          url: "https://api.example.com/data",
          method: "GET",
          success: function(response) {
              var jsonData = JSON.parse(response);
              // Process jsonData
          },
          error: function(error) {
              // Handle error
          }
      });
      ```







**16. Explain how animations are achieved using jQuery.**

    - Animations in jQuery are achieved using methods like `fadeIn()`, `fadeOut()`, `slideUp()`, and `slideDown()`. These methods change the visibility or size of elements over a specified duration.








**17. What is the difference between the `show()`, `hide()`, and `toggle()` functions in jQuery?**

    - `show()`: Displays the selected element.
    - `hide()`: Hides the selected element.
    - `toggle()`: Toggles between showing and hiding the selected element.







**18. How can you create custom animations using jQuery?**

    - Custom animations can be created using the `animate()` method. It allows you to define custom CSS properties and values to animate over a specified duration.






**19. What are jQuery plugins? Provide an example of a popular jQuery plugin.**

    - jQuery plugins are additional libraries that extend jQuery's functionality. Example plugin: jQuery UI, which provides widgets and interactions like date pickers, sliders, and drag-and-drop functionality.






**20. How would you create a simple image slider using jQuery?**

    - You can create an image slider by toggling the visibility of multiple images using the `fadeOut()` and `fadeIn()` methods, along with timers or event handlers to control the slide transitions.
