Answer

01.]]]
To sort the result set based on one or more columns

The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on the specified column(s).






02.
AVG

The AVG function in MariaDB is used to calculate the average of numeric column values. It adds up all the values in the specified column and divides the total by the number of rows to find the average






03.]]]
LEFT JOIN includes unmatched rows from the left table, and RIGHT JOIN includes unmatched rows from the right table.

LEFT JOIN returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match for a row in the left table, NULL values are returned for the right table columns. RIGHT JOIN does the same, but it includes all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.







04.
GROUP BY

The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows in a MariaDB query based on the values in one or more columns.





05.]]]
It is placed before the column names you want to select.

To select distinct values from specific columns, you place the DISTINCT keyword before the column names in the SELECT statement.





06.]]]
The INNER JOIN will behave like a CROSS JOIN and return the Cartesian product.

If there is no specified condition using the ON clause in an INNER JOIN, it will behave like a CROSS JOIN, which returns the Cartesian product of both tables. This means every row from the first table will be paired with every row from the second table.




07.]]]
SELECT

The SELECT keyword is used in MariaDB to perform aggregation functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, and MIN. Aggregation queries allow you to calculate values based on groups of rows in a table.





08.
It specifies the starting point from where rows should be retrieved.

The OFFSET clause is used to specify the starting point or offset from where rows should be retrieved in a result set. It is often used in combination with the LIMIT clause to implement pagination.





09.
LIMIT

The LIMIT clause allows you to specify the maximum number of rows to be returned in the result set.





10.
