1. **How do you filter data in SQL queries?**
   Filtering data in SQL queries is commonly done using the `WHERE` clause. 
   This clause allows you to specify conditions that the data must meet to be included in the query results. 
   
   For example:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
   ```






2. **Explain the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses.**]]]
   - `WHERE` is used to filter rows before any groupings are made. 
      It filters individual rows based on specified conditions.
   - `HAVING` is used to filter rows after the grouping has occurred. 
      It filters grouped rows based on specified conditions.






3. **When would you use the ORDER BY clause?**
   The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns either in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. 
   It's useful when you want the query results to be displayed in a particular order.







4. **What does the DISTINCT keyword do in SQL?**
   The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to retrieve unique values from a specific column or columns in a table. 
   It eliminates duplicate rows from the result set.







5. **Can you provide an example of when you might use DISTINCT in a query?**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
   ```
   This would retrieve distinct values from the specified column in the table.







6. **What is the purpose of the LIMIT clause?**
   The `LIMIT` clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. 
   It's often used in conjunction with `ORDER BY` to retrieve a specific number of rows from the result set.






7. **How does the OFFSET clause work in SQL queries?**
   The `OFFSET` clause, used in combination with `LIMIT`, specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows from the query. It is commonly used for pagination.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
   ```
   This query would skip the first 20 rows and retrieve the next 10 rows.






8. **Explain the difference between COUNT and COUNT(*) in SQL.**
   - `COUNT(column_name)` counts the number of non-null values in the specified column.
   - `COUNT(*)` counts the total number of rows in a table, including rows with null values.






9. **When would you use SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN functions in SQL queries?**
   - `SUM`: When you want to get the sum of values in a column.
   - `AVG`: When you want to calculate the average of values in a column.
   - `MAX`: When you want to find the maximum value in a column.
   - `MIN`: When you want to find the minimum value in a column.






10. **Can you give an example of using these functions in a query?**
    ```sql
    SELECT 
     SUM(column_name), 
     AVG(column_name), 
     MAX(column_name), 
     MIN(column_name) 
    FROM table_name;
    ```







11. **What does the GROUP BY clause do in SQL?**
    The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns. 
    It's often used with aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group separately.






12. **How is the GROUP BY clause different from the WHERE clause?**
    - `WHERE` filters individual rows before grouping.
    - `GROUP BY` groups rows based on common values in specified columns after the filtering has occurred.






13. **Explain the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN.**
    - `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
    - `OUTER JOIN` returns all rows from both tables and fills in NULLs for missing matches.





14. **When would you use LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN?**
    - `LEFT JOIN`: When you want all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
    - `RIGHT JOIN`: When you want all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
    - `FULL JOIN`: When you want all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.





15. **What is a Cartesian Join and when might it be used?**
    A Cartesian Join (also known as a cross join) returns the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning it combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table. 
    It might be used in specific cases where all combinations between two tables are needed, but it should be used cautiously as it can result in a large number of rows.
