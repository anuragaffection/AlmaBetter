**Database Transactions:**

1. ACID properties stand for:
   a) Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Derivation
   b) Aggregation, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
   c) Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
   d) Atomicity, Continuity, Isolation, Durability






2. Transaction State "Partially Committed" occurs:
   a) Before executing any operations
   b) After executing all operations successfully
   c) After executing all operations but before the final commitment
   d) After a transaction is rolled back






3. A database transaction is a(n) __________ unit of work performed against a database.
   a) Physical
   b) Logical
   c) Hybrid
   d) Discrete






4. Savepoints in a database transaction allow for:]]]
   a) Only forward movement within the transaction
   b) Partial rollback within the transaction
   c) Complete rollback of the transaction
   d) Pausing and resuming the transaction







5. The ER model primarily consists of:
   a) Entities, Rows, and Columns
   b) Entities, Attributes, and Relationships
   c) Rows, Attributes, and Tables
   d) Tables, Attributes, and Relationships







6. In an ER diagram, the oval-shaped figures represent:
   a) Entities
   b) Attributes
   c) Relationships
   d) Cardinality







7. Cardinality in an ER diagram defines the:]]]
   a) Type of entity
   b) Type of attribute
   c) Nature of the relationship between entities
   d) Number of relationships






8. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, __________.
9. Transaction state "Aborted" occurs when a transaction encounters an __________ or is intentionally rolled back.
10. An ER model is a conceptual representation of data using entities, __________, and relationships.
11. In ER diagrams, cardinality indicates the __________ of relationships between entities.
12. ER diagram implementation involves converting entities into __________ and attributes into columns.
