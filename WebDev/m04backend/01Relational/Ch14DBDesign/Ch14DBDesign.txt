    -- 3. Physical design

    Logical vs Physical design
    -- The logical model focuses on data entities, attributes, and relationships, 
       while the physical model deals with storage, indexes, and optimization.

Normalization {
    -- minimize data redundancy 

    Normal forms
    -- 
    
    1NF, 2NF, 3NF implementation
    -- 1NF
    -- 2NF
    -- 3NF
    -- 4NF
    -- 5NF 
    -- BCNF 

    1NF (First Normal Form): 
    -- Ensures that each column contains only atomic (indivisible) values.
    
    2NF (Second Normal Form): 
    -- Further eliminates partial dependencies within a table.

    3NF (Third Normal Form): 
    -- Eliminates transitive dependencies between columns.

    01. Database design ensures that data is organized, efficient, and easy to manage.
    
    02. Database design is a one-time process that doesn't require any updates or modifications over time.
    
    03. The logical data model deals with the implementation details and storage considerations of the database.
    
    04. Schema design refers to the process of creating a blueprint for organizing and structuring a database.
    
    05. The Database Life Cycle consists of only one phase, which is the design phase.

    01. In Database Normalization, the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate _____________(redundancy / complexity) is known as normalization.
    
    02. The first normal form (1NF) requires that each column in a table must contain ___________(indexed / atomic) values.
    
    03. 3NF Implementation involves removing ______________(transitive / nullable) dependencies.
    
    04. In 2NF, a table is typically divided into multiple tables to eliminate data ___________(normalisation / redundancy).
    
    05. An attribute is said to be in the ___________(2NF / 3NF) form if it is not transitively dependent on the primary key.
