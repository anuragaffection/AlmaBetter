Answer


01.
SOAP

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a type of web service that relies on XML- based messaging. It defines a set of rules for structuring messages and provides a standardized way for applications to communicate and perform remote procedure calls.



02.
Tight coupling between systems

One of the benefits of using web services is interoperability, which allows different systems to communicate regardless of their underlying technologies. Tight coupling between systems, on the other hand, can lead to dependencies and difficulties in maintaining and scaling applications.




03.
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

HTTP methods such as GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (delete) are used in Web APIs to perform CRUD operations on resources.





04.
Application Programming Interface

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.




05.
200 OK

The 200 OK status code indicates that the request was successful and the server is providing the expected response.




06.
application/json

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used format for sending structured data in Web API requests and responses.





07.
WebSocket

WebSocket is a protocol that enables two- way communication between a client and server over a single, long-lived connection, allowing real-time updates and data exchange





08.
A standardized way for different software applications to communicate over the internet.

A web service is a software component or application that provides a standardized way for different software systems to communicate and interact with each other over the internet. It allows applications to exchange data and perform operations regardless of the programming languages or platforms they are built on.




09.
Seamless integration of incompatible systems

One of the main advantages of using web services is their ability to enable seamless integration between different applications and systems, even if they are built on different technologies or platforms. Web services provide a standardized way for these systems to communicate and exchange data, overcoming compatibility challenges.




10.
Postman

Postman is a popular tool for manual testing and exploring APIs. It allows users to send requests, view responses, and analyze API behavior.
