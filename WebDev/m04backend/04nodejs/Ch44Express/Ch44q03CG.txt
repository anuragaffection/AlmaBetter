Absolutely! Here are the answers to those interview questions:

1. **Difference between PUT and POST in RESTful APIs:**
    - **PUT:** Typically used to update an existing resource. The entire resource is replaced with the new representation sent in the request.
    - **POST:** Used to create a new resource or perform a specific action on the server. The server determines the URL of the newly created resource.



2. **Middleware in Express.js:**
    - Middleware in Express.js functions between a request and a response. It can modify the request, response objects, or execute code before passing control to the next middleware in the stack.



3. **Difference between RESTful API and SOAP-based web services:**
    - RESTful APIs are lighter, utilize HTTP protocol more directly, and are stateless, while SOAP-based web services rely on XML and can use various protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.) and tend to be more complex.



4. **Advantages of Express.js for server-side development:**
    - It's minimalistic, fast, and unopinionated, allowing flexibility in application structure. It provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.



5. **Role of HTTP status codes in RESTful APIs:**
    - HTTP status codes indicate the outcome of a client's request. For instance, 200 OK signifies success, 404 Not Found indicates the requested resource was not found, etc.



6. **Purpose of "body-parser" middleware in Express:**
    - "body-parser" is used to parse incoming request bodies in middleware before handlers, allowing easy access to the parsed data.



7. **Steps to set up a basic Express server:**
    - Install Node.js and Express.js.
    - Create a new directory, initialize npm, and install Express.
    - Create an Express app, define routes, and start the server.



8. **Express routing and significance of route parameters:**
    - Express routing defines how an application responds to client requests. Route parameters are placeholders in the URL pattern that capture values specified at those positions.



9. **Main components of an HTTP request:**
    - URL, method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, body (optional for some methods like GET).



10. **Scenarios for using Postman for API testing:**
    - Postman is useful for testing APIs during development, allowing the execution of various requests, testing parameters, headers, authentication, and viewing responses.



11. **Purpose of CORS and handling it in Express:**
    - CORS allows controlled access to resources located outside a given domain. In Express, it's managed through middleware like "cors" to define which origins have access.



12. **Concept of statelessness in RESTful APIs:**
    - Statelessness means each request from a client to the server must contain all necessary information for the server to fulfill it, without relying on the server's previous state.



13. **Error handling in Express:**
    - Error handling in Express involves using middleware with four parameters (err, req, res, next) to handle errors that occur during request processing.



14. **Difference between authentication and authorization in APIs and implementation in Express:**
    - Authentication verifies a user's identity, while authorization grants or denies access to resources based on the authenticated user's permissions. In Express, middleware like Passport.js can be used for authentication and authorization.



15. **Significance of query strings in HTTP requests and handling in Express:**
    - Query strings in URLs allow passing parameters to control and filter the results of a request. In Express, query strings are accessed using `req.query` and can be used to modify the response.
