01. What is DBMS {
    -- data 
    -- information 
    -- types of data 
    -- Atomicity = complete in single  shot 
    -- redundancy = duplicate 
    -- inconsistency = error, unmatch, not same 
    
}




02. DBMS architecture and DBA {

    -- schema = design = blueprint 
    -- run length encoding 

    -- physical level or internal level 
    -- logical level or conceptual level
    -- view level or external level 

    -- instance of db = conditions of db at specific time 
    -- data model     = way to describe schema of db 

    -- DDL  = definition = drop, create 
    -- DML  = Manipulation = delete, update, insert,
    -- JDBC = java data base connectivity 
    -- ODBC = 
    -- DBA  = Database Administrator = have access to whole data 

    -- tier 1 architecture = client, server, database  all are at same device 
    -- tier 2 architecture = client at one device, database at server [client direct calling to db]
    -- tier 3 architecture = client call to application then application call to server


}

    -- Entity Relationship Model
    -- Works on conceptual or logical level
