10.
Which of the following is used to style React components?

HTML
CSS
JSX
Express.js







Answer


01. Express.js]]

Express.js is a backend framework for Node.js that is commonly used in the MERN stack. It handles HTTP requests, routing, and middleware, allowing you to define routes and manage the server-side logic for your application.





02.
A project that involves developing both front- end and back-end components of a web application.

A full stack project involves creating all the necessary components of a web application, including both front-end (user interface) and back-end (server-side logic and database). It encompasses the entire technology stack required to build and deploy a functional web application.





03.
They can communicate effectively with stakeholders.]]

A full stack developer possesses knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies, which enables effective communication between various teams involved in the project. They can bridge the gap between design, development, and business aspects of the project.






04.
NoSQL database

MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it does not use a traditional relational schema. It stores data in a flexible and scalable format, making it suitable for dynamic and rapidly changing applications.





05.
MongoDB

MongoDB is the preferred database in the MERN stack due to its compatibility with JavaScript and JSON-like document format, making it a seamless choice for the backend when working with Node.js and Express.js.




06.
Server-side routing and middleware

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a way to handle server-side routing and middleware functions. It is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, defining routes, and processing middleware such as authentication, logging, etc.





07.
A syntax extension for JavaScript used in React components.

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used in React to describe what the Ul should look like. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and render React components





08.
Manage and display user interfaces.

React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive Ul components that efficiently update when data changes. React is responsible for managing the frontend presentation and user experience.






09.
Handling server-side logic

Node.js is used in the MERN stack to handle server-side logic and to build scalable and efficient network applications. It allows developers to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend development.





10.
CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is commonly used to style React components. You can apply styles using inline styles, CSS modules, or CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.
