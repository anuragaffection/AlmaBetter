Answer

01.
Limited accessibility

Cloud computing is characterized by its high accessibility, allowing users to access resources from anywhere with an internet connection. Limited accessibility is not a characteristic of cloud computing.



02.
Scalable compute capacity

Amazon EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers by providing virtual servers called instances.




03.
Reduced hardware maintenance

Cloud computing eliminates the need for organizations to maintain and manage physical hardware infrastructure. This reduces costs and operational efforts associated with hardware maintenance, upgrades, and repairs.




04.
Amazon Web Services

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services, which is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.




05.
Public cloud

In a public cloud, resources are shared among multiple organizations or users over the internet. This model offers cost savings and scalability but may have less control over security compared to private or hybrid clouds.




06.
Automatically adjusting resource capacity

Cloud elasticity allows resources to be automatically scaled up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.




07.
Amazon S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable storage service that allows users to store and retrieve data objects, often used for hosting static assets, backup and archiving, and content distribution.




08.
MongoDB


Amazon RDS primarily supports relational database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. MongoDB is a NoSQL database engine and is not directly supported by Amazon RDS. However, Amazon offers another service called Amazon DocumentDB, which is compatible with MongoDB.





09.
Private cloud

A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization, providing greater control, security, and customization. This model is suitable for organizations with stringent security requirements.





10.
Amazon RDS

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed database service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
