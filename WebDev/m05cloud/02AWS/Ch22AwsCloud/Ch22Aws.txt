Overview of Cloud {
    -- on demand access 
    -- rapid elasticity 
    -- resource pooling 
    -- measured uses 
}



Cloud Service Models {
    
    IaaS 
    -- infrastructure as a service 
    -- 

    PaaS 
    -- platform as a service 
    -- AWS elastic beanstalk 
    -- Azure app service
    -- Google app engine 

    SaaS 
    -- Software as a service
