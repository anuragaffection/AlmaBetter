Cloud Service Models {
    
    IaaS 
    -- infrastructure as a service 
    -- foundational layer 
    -- provide virtual computing service 
    -- we rent IT infrastructure
    -- we rent virtual machine (VMs)
    -- we rent cpu, memory, storage 
    -- block Storage  = Amazon EBS, Azure Disk 
    -- object Storage = Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage 
    -- File Storage   = Amazon EFS, Azure Files 
    -- eg.  Amazon EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine 


    PaaS 
    -- platform as a service 
    -- Auto Scaling 
    -- AWS elastic beanstalk 
    -- Azure app service
    -- Google app engine 


    SaaS 
    -- Software as a service
    -- highest layer of cloud
    -- we get ready to use application
    -- Customer Relationship Management 
    -- Salesforce(CRM)
    -- Google Workspace (G suite)
    -- Microsoft 365
    -- DropBox 
    -- 


    IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS
    -- IaaS offers   infrastructure resources, 
    -- PaaS provides development platforms, 
    -- SaaS delivers fully managed software applications.

Cloud Deployment Models {

    public Cloud
    -- aws 
    -- DropBox
    -- google drive 
    -- Microsoft 365 
    -- 

    private Cloud
    -- dedicated to single organization
    -- resources are not stored to other organization
    -- private cloud is expensive
    -- used when strict data privacy needed 
    -- used by financial, healthcare, government agencies 

    hybrid Cloud
    -- combination of public & private cloud
    -- use public cloud, during peak hour 
    -- use private cloud, to store sensitive data 

    community Cloud
    -- shared by multiple organization
    -- 

    multi cloud
    -- combination of public, private, hybrid, community
}
