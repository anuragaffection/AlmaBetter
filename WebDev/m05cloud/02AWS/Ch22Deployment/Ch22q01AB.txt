Answer

01.
Improving user satisfaction and usability

The primary goal of UX design is to create user-centric interfaces that enhance user satisfaction and usability, making it easier and more enjoyable for users to interact with a product or service.





02.
Enabling communication between frontend and backend

Integrating backend APIs allows the frontend and backend of an application to communicate and exchange data, enabling the frontend to request and receive information from the backend.




03.
Browser

In a single-page application (SPA), client- side routing is managed by the browser using JavaScript. The browser updates the URL and dynamically loads content without requiring a full page refresh.




04.
Complexity and Confusion

Good Ul design aims to simplify the user experience and reduce complexity, not increase it. Complexity and confusion are contrary to the principles of good Ul design.




05.]]]
app.route('/users').get(...).post(...)

In Express.js, you can use the app.route() method to define multiple route handlers for a single path. The .get(...) and .post(...) methods can be chained to define handlers for GET and POST requests, respectively.



06.
User Interface

Ul stands for User Interface. It refers to the graphical layout, visual elements, and overall design of a software application that users interact with.




07.]]]
HTML

While HTML is a markup language used for rendering web content in browsers, JSON, XML, and YAML are commonly used formats for data exchange between frontend and backend in API communication.




08.
Designing interfaces for various screen sizes and devices

Responsive design refers to the practice of designing interfaces that adapt and respond effectively to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent and optimal user experience across platforms.




09.
To centralize and manage the state of an application.

Redux is a state management library that centralizes the application's state and provides a predictable way to manage and update that state throughout the application.




10.
Navigating between different pages or views

Routing refers to the process of determining which component or view should be displayed when a user clicks on a link or enters a specific URL. It allows for navigation between different parts of a web application without the need to refresh the entire page.
