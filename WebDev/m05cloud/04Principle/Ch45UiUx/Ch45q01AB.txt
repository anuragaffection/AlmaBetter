Answer


01.
It relates to the mental effort required to use a product

Cognitive load relates to the mental effort required to use a product, measuring the mental burden placed on users during interaction.





02.
All of the above

Designing responsive interfaces requires considerations such as consistency across devices, fast loading times, and easy navigation to ensure a seamless user experience across different screen sizes and platforms.




03.
To create a sense of balance and alignment

Grid systems in Ul design serve the purpose of creating a sense of balance and alignment among design elements, enhancing visual cohesion and organization.





04.
It involves experts evaluating a design based on usability principles

Heuristic evaluation involves experts evaluating a design based on usability principles, providing insights into potential usability issues and improvements.






05.
It organizes and prioritizes elements based on their importance

Visual hierarchy organizes and prioritizes elements based on their importance, directing user attention and guiding them through the interface effectively.





06.
All of the above

Circles, squares, and triangles are basic shapes commonly used in UI/UX design.





07.
By representing the target users' needs and goals

Personas, representing the target users' needs and goals, inform the wireframing process by ensuring the design aligns with user expectations and objectives.




08.
Interviews
Observational studies

Usability testing commonly involves techniques such as interviews and observational studies to gather insights on user behavior and interaction with a design.





09.
Evaluating design effectiveness

Design evaluation is important in UX design to assess the effectiveness of a design solution.





10.
It suggests the functionality or purpose of an object or element

Affordance suggests the functionality or purpose of an object or element, helping users understand how to interact with it within a design context.
