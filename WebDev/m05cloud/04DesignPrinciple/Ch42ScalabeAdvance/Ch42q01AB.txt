Answer
01.
To determine the economic viability of the project ]]]

Feasibility studies assess the economic, technical, and operational aspects of a software project to determine its economic viability, considering factors such as costs, benefits, and risks.




02.
Tracking changes and facilitating collaboration

Version control systems help track changes to source code, facilitate collaboration among team members, and enable seamless integration of code changes.




03.
To provide guidance for maintenance and future development

Software documentation helps in understanding the software's architecture, design, functionality, and usage, providing essential guidance for maintenance, troubleshooting, and future development efforts.




04.
Continuous integration (CI) ]]]

Continuous integration involves frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, accompanied by automated builds, tests, and deployments, enabling smaller, incremental releases.




05.
System testing ]]]

System testing evaluates the behavior and performance of a complete software system in a real-world environment to ensure its proper functioning and adherence to requirements.




06.
Work breakdown structure (WBS)

The work breakdown structure (WBS) involves breaking down the project work into smaller, manageable units called tasks or user stories, facilitating planning and task allocation.




07.
To review and reflect on the completed sprint ]]]

Retrospective meetings in Agile allow the team to review the previous sprint, discuss challenges, successes, and areas for improvement, and make adjustments to enhance future sprints.





08.
Reusable and maintainable code ]]]

Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common software design problems, enabling the development of modular, flexible, and maintainable code.




09.
To ensure code meets coding standards

Code reviews help ensure that code adheres to established coding standards, maintains code quality, and follows best practices.





10.
Acceptance testing

Acceptance testing is performed to verify that the software meets the specified requirements and obtains approval from the stakeholders or end users.



11.
Continuous delivery (CD)

Continuous delivery focuses on continuously delivering software in small, incremental releases, ensuring that it is always in a releasable state.




12.
Corrective maintenance

Corrective maintenance involves identifying and fixing defects or bugs in software without introducing new functionality or changing its existing behavior.




13.
Scrum

Scrum is an Agile framework that involves breaking down software development tasks into smaller units called user stories, which are prioritized and completed in iterative sprints.




14.
Code refactoring

Code refactoring involves restructuring and improving code without changing its external behavior, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code.





15.
Unit testing

Unit testing focuses on testing individual software components or units to ensure they function as intended. It involves testing small, isolated portions of code.
