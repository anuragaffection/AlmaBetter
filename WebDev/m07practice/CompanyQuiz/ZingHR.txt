Answer

01.
When the component needs to manage its own data and respond to state changes

You should use a stateful component in React when the component needs to manage its own data and respond to state changes. Stateful components are used when you need to maintain and update internal state.






02.
They receive data via props and do not have internal state

Stateless components in React receive data via props and do not have internal state. They are primarily responsible for rendering based on the data they receive.






03.
Building user interfaces

React.js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces and managing the state of UI components efficiently.






04.
To memoize a callback function.

useCallback is used to memoize a callback function, ensuring that the callback does not change between renders unless its dependencies change. This can help in optimizing performance when passing callbacks to child components.






05.
Using curly braces

In React, you can destructure an object in a component's function parameter by using curly braces. For example, you can destructure props like this: function MyComponent({ prop1, prop2 })

{...}.







06.
To share behavior between components

HOCs are commonly used to share behavior and functionality between multiple components






07.
To handle routing and navigation in single- page applications

React Router is a library used to handle routing and navigation in single-page applications built with React.





08.
Use the this.props object

You can pass data from a parent component to a child component in React by using the props property.





09.
A component that manages and stores its own data

A stateful component in React is a component that manages and stores its own data using the state property. It can hold and update data over time, which makes it capable of responding to changes in its internal state.






10.
It provides a unique identifier for each element in the list

The key prop is used to provide a unique identifier for each element in a list, helping React identify and update elements efficiently.







11.
A function that takes a component and returns a new component

A HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced functionality.




12.
To spread an array into individual elements.

The rest operator (...) in JavaScript is used to spread an array into individual elements. It allows you to extract the remaining elements of an array into a new array, function parameters, or object properties.





13.
constructor

The constructor method is called when a React component is first created. It's used for initializing state and other setup.






14.
To specify how the component should be displayed

The render method is used to describe what the component should render to the DOM.






15.
It collects all function arguments into an array.

The rest operator in function parameters collects all the remaining function arguments into an array, regardless of their data types or how many arguments are passed.






16.
A method to break down complex objects into simpler ones.

Object destructuring in React is a technique for breaking down complex objects (like props or state) into simpler ones by extracting specific properties from the object. It allows you to extract and use only the properties you need, making your code more concise and readable.







17.
useContext

useContext hook is used to access shared state and logic between components when using the Context API. It allows components to subscribe to changes in a global context and access its values.






18.
A lightweight copy of the HTML DOM

The virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the HTML DOM. React uses it to optimize rendering performance.






19.
When you need to perform a layout-related side effect.

useLayoutEffect is similar to useEffect, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. It should be used when you need to perform a side effect that relies on the layout of the elements in the DOM.





20.
Wrap the component with the HOC function

You wrap the component with the HOC function to enhance its functionality.





21.
useEffect is used for handling side effects in functional components.

useEffect is used for handling side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM, in functional components. It runs asynchronously after rendering.






22.
array1 = [...array1, ...array2]

You can use the rest operator to combine two arrays by spreading their elements into a new array as shown in option 4. Options 1 and 3 are valid but do not use the rest operator. Option 2 is incorrect syntax.






23.
Use the componentDidMount lifecycle method

The componentDidMount lifecycle method is a common place to fetch data from a server in React, as it ensures that the component has been rendered to the DOM.






24.
To memoize the result of an expensive computation.

useMemo is used to memoize the result of an expensive computation, ensuring that the computation is only executed when the dependencies change. It helps improve the performance of your components by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.






25.
function

In modern React, you define a stateless functional component using the function keyword. This type of component is also known as a functional component.





26.
JavaScript XML

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code.






27.
Use the onChange event

The onChange event is commonly used to handle user input in React forms, allowing you to capture and update input values.







28.
function sum(...numbers) { return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num);

}

Option 1 correctly uses the rest operator to collect multiple function arguments into the numbers array. Options B and C are incorrect syntax, and option D creates a new array unnecessarily.






29.
A component that doesn't store any data

A stateless component in React, also known as a functional component, does not manage its own data using the state property. Instead, it receives data via its props and renders based on that data. It doesn't have internal state.







30.
const [first, ...rest] = myArray;

Option 1 demonstrates the correct usage of the rest operator to extract specific elements from an array. It assigns the first element of myArray to first and spreads the remaining elements into the rest array. The other options have incorrect syntax.
