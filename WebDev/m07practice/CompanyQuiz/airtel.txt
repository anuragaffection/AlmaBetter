Anwer


01.
A JavaScript framework for building web applications.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web applications






02.
JavaScript XML for defining component structure

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your React components.






03.
Content-Type

The Content-Type header specifies the type of data a resource contains, such as HTML, image, or text, helping the browser interpret and display the content correctly




04.
It reduces the need for reflows and repaints.

The virtual DOM helps optimize performance by minimizing the number of changes that need to be made to the Real DOM, thereby reducing reflows and repaints.




05.]]]]
There is no performance difference between reading and writing.

Writing to the Real DOM is typically more performance-intensive because it involves making changes to the actual web page structure, leading to reflows and repaints.





06. <ol>

The <ol> element is used to create an ordered (numbered) list. <ul> is used for unordered (bulleted) lists, <li> represents list items, and <dl> is used for definition lists.






07.
A process that calculates the layout and positioning of elements.

Reflow is the process where the browser calculates the layout and positioning of elements on the web page, which can be triggered by changes in the Real DOM.





08.
Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation optimized for updates.

Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation designed for efficient updates, while the real DOM is the actual browser representation of the document structure.





09.
useState

useState is used to manage component- level state in a functional component, allowing you to declare and update state variables.





10.
<p>

By default, the <p> element is a block-level element, which means it starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its container.





11.
Inside the element's opening tag

The style attribute is placed within the opening tag of the HTML element you want to style. For example: <p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>






12.
The last rule in the stylesheet

When conflicting rules have the same specificity, the last rule in the stylesheet takes precedence. This is known as the "Cascading" aspect of CSS.






13.
An abstract representation of the actual DOM

The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual Document Object Model (DOM) in web development. It is used to improve the efficiency of updating the actual DOM by minimizing direct manipulation.






14.
document.createElement

document.createElement allows you to create new HTML elements in memory without triggering immediate reflows or repaints, making it more efficient for Real DOM manipulation.





15.
It is a physical representation of the web page.

The Real DOM is a physical, tangible representation of the web page's structure in memory, consisting of all the HTML elements.





16.
To manage state and side effects in functional components

React hooks, like useState and useEffect, are used to manage state and side effects in functional components, making it easier to reuse and maintain the component's logic.





17.
To improve the performance of DOM updates

The Virtual DOM is primarily used to optimize the performance of updating the actual DOM by reducing the number of real DOM manipulations.






18.
The component's structure (UI).

The "render" method in a React component returns the component's structure, which defines the user interface.






19.
Domain Name System

The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating human- readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing your browser to locate the correct server when you click a URL.





20.
Path

The path component of a URL identifies a specific resource on the server, such as a file or page. It follows the domain or host name in the URL.






21.
Using the "props" system

Data is passed from a parent component to a child component in React using the "props" system.






22.
To perform side effects in functional components

useEffect is used to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or setting up subscriptions.






23.
<head>

The <head> element is used to define the structure of an HTML document by providing metadata such as the title, links to external resources (e.g., stylesheets and scripts), and other information that is not directly displayed in the web page. Options B, C, and D represent elements that are contained within the <head> section.







24.
0,1,2,0

A selector with specificity (0, 1, 2, 0) has 0 inline styles, 1 ID selector, 2 class/attribute/pseudo-class selectors, and 0 element selectors.






25.
To manage component properties.

In React, "state" is used to manage component-specific data and properties.






26.
1,0,0,0

Inline styles have the highest specificity. In this case, there is one inline style, so the specificity is (1,0,0,0).






27.
div#header div.menu a

The specificity is calculated as (0,1,1,3) for option 3. It has an ID selector (#header), one class selector (.menu), and three element selectors (div and a) in the selector chain, giving it the highest specificity.






28.
Define character encoding for the document

The <meta> tag is primarily used to define the character encoding for the HTML document, ensuring proper rendering of text and special characters. Option B is related to the <link> tag for external stylesheets, option C is related to the <a> tag for creating links, and option D is related to the <hr> tag for horizontal rules.






29.
alt

he alt attribute is used to specify the alternate text for an image. This text is displayed when the image cannot be loaded or by screen readers to describe the image to visually impaired users. Options A, C, and D are used for different purposes related to images and links.





30.
useContext

useContext can be used to access the Redux store and dispatch actions in a React component when combined with the useDispatch function.
