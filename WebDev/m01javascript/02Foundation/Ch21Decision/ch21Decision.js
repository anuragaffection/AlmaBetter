   chapter notes 


   01. if statements 
   --- syntax
   --- boolean expression 
   --- 



   02. if else 
   --- syntax



   03. nested if 
   --- concise code of if & if else 
   --- no need to use {} , if there is only one branch
   --- 



   04.  Switch 
   ---  alternative of  `if else`
   ---  syntax 
   ---  `break`
   ---  `default` 
   ---  omitting 'break` keyword 
   ---  `break`         ==  used to exit the current loop 
   ---  `typeof`        ==  
   ---  `instancof`     == 
   ---  `parseFloat()`  ==  convert to number 
   ---  `prompt`        ==  to take input in browser 
   ---  `alert`         ==  to show alert in browser 



   05. switch with multiple case 
   --- falling throught concept in switch 
   --- 


   06. ternary operator syntax
   --- 


   07. truthy & falsy 
   --- falsy value  =  false, 0, '', null, NaN, undefined
   --- 
   
   
   08. Comparison 
   ---  === 
   ---  ==
   ---  !==
   ---  !=
   ---  && 
   ---  ||
   ---  ! 
   ---  && and || = use short circuit evaluation 
   ---  null & undefined =

   Activity true or false 

   01. JavaScript has an if-else statement that can execute a block of code if the if condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false. 

   02. Nested if-else statements can be used to test multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on those conditions. 

   03. The if-else statement cannot have more than two branches. 

   04. In JavaScript, you can use a single statement as the body of an if-else statement without using curly braces.

   05. Using curly braces for single-statement if-else blocks is always mandatory. 


  Answers
  01. True
  02. True
  03. False
  04. True
  05. False
