   chapter notes 


   01. if statements 
   --- syntax
   --- boolean expression 
   --- 





   02. if else 
   --- syntax





   03. nested if 
   --- concise code of if & if else 
   --- no need to use {} , if there is only one branch
   --- 






   04.  Switch 
   ---  alternative of  `if else`
   ---  syntax 
   ---  `break`
   ---  `default` 
   ---  omitting 'break` keyword 
   ---  `break`         ==  used to exit the current loop 
   ---  `typeof`        ==  
   ---  `instancof`     == 
   ---  `parseFloat()`  ==  convert to number 
   ---  `prompt`        ==  to take input in browser 
   ---  `alert`         ==  to show alert in browser 







   05. switch with multiple case 
   --- falling throught concept in switch 
   --- 






   06. ternary operator syntax
   --- 




   07. truthy & falsy 
   --- falsy value  =  false, 0, '', null, NaN, undefined
   --- 
   
   


   08. Comparison 
   ---  === 
   ---  ==
   ---  !==
   ---  !=
   ---  && 
   ---  ||
   ---  ! 
   ---  && and || = use short circuit evaluation 
   ---  null & undefined =

   Activity true or false 


   01. JavaScript has an if-else statement that can execute a block of code if the if condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false. 



    02. Nested if-else statements can be used to test multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on those conditions. 



    03. The if-else statement cannot have more than two branches. 



    04. In JavaScript, you can use a single statement as the body of an if-else statement without using curly braces.



    05. Using curly braces for single-statement if-else blocks is always mandatory. 




  Answers
  01. True
  02. True
  03. False
  04. True
  05. False

1. What is the purpose of an `if` statement in JavaScript?
   a. To define a function
   b. To declare a variable
   c. To control the flow of code based on a condition
   d. To create a loop


   


2. Which of the following statements is true about the `if-else` statement?
   a. It can have multiple `else` blocks.
   b. It can only have one `if` block and one `else` block.
   c. It can have multiple `if` blocks.
   d. It can't have an `else` block.


   


3. What is the purpose of nested `if` statements?
   a. To improve code performance
   b. To make the code more readable
   c. To check multiple conditions sequentially
   d. To create an infinite loop


   


4. Which control structure is used to replace a series of `if-else` statements when you need to select one option among many?
   a. for loop
   b. switch statement
   c. while loop
   d. do-while loop


   



5. In a JavaScript `switch` statement, when should you use the `break` statement?
   a. Before each `case` label
   b. After each `case` block
   c. Only when you want to exit the `switch` statement
   d. When you want to combine multiple `case` values


   



6. What is the result of the following expression: `x > 5 ? "A" : "B"` if `x` is equal to 3?
   a. "A"
   b. "B"
   c. Error
   d. undefined


   



7. Which of the following values is considered "falsy" in JavaScript?
   a. 0
   b. " "
   c. NaN
   d. All of the above






8. What is the correct way to compare two values for both value and type equality in JavaScript?
   a. `==`
   b. `===`
   c. `=`
   d. `!=`




Answers:
1. c - to control the flow of code based on condition 
2. a - it can have multipel else blocks 
3. c - to check multiple conditions sequentially 
4. b - switch statements 
5. c - only when you want to exit the 'switch' statements
6. b - B
7. d - all of the above 
8. b - `===`

  quiz 03 CG



1. Explain the difference between `if`, `if-else`, and `if-else if` statements in JavaScript. When would you use each of them?



2. What is the purpose of a nested `if` statement? Can you provide an example of when it might be useful?



3. How do you write an `if` statement that checks if a variable is undefined or null?



4. What is short-circuiting in JavaScript conditionals, and how can it be useful in your code?




5. Explain when it is more appropriate to use a `switch` statement instead of a series of `if-else` statements. Provide an example scenario.




6. How does the `break` statement work in a `switch` statement? Why is it important?




7. Can you use non-integer values as case labels in a `switch` statement? If so, provide an example.





8. What is the purpose of the ternary operator (`? :`) in JavaScript? Provide an example of how it can be used.




9. When should you use a ternary operator, and when should you use an `if-else` statement to achieve the same result? Are there any performance differences between the two?





10. Explain what truthy and falsy values are in JavaScript. Provide examples of values that are considered truthy and values that are considered falsy.




11. How can you use truthy and falsy values to write concise conditional statements in JavaScript?



12. Describe the difference between the `==` and `===` operators in JavaScript. When should you use one over the other?




13. What is type coercion in JavaScript comparisons, and how can you prevent unexpected results when using it?




14. Explain the concept of operator precedence in JavaScript and how it affects comparison operations.
