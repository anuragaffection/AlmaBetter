8. How can you use the `MutationObserver` API to monitor changes in the DOM?
   a) By using the `window.addEventListener` method
   b) By setting up a server-side listener
   c) By attaching event listeners to target elements
   d) By creating an observer instance and defining its callback

10. In the context of libraries like React, what is the purpose of the Virtual DOM?
   a) To render the entire DOM as an image
   b) To optimize JavaScript execution
   c) To create virtual web applications
   d) To improve performance in updating the actual DOM







11. How does asynchronous loading of scripts affect page rendering?
    a) It blocks rendering until scripts are loaded
    b) It improves rendering by loading scripts asynchronously
    c) It delays rendering until all styles are applied
    d) It prevents rendering until all images are loaded







12. What is the difference between the `load` event and the `DOMContentLoaded` event?
    a) `load` event fires when scripts are loaded, `DOMContentLoaded` fires when HTML is parsed
    b) `load` event fires when CSS is loaded, `DOMContentLoaded` fires when scripts are executed
    c) `load` event fires when all resources are loaded, `DOMContentLoaded` fires when HTML is parsed
    d) `load` event fires when the page is opened, `DOMContentLoaded` fires when the page is closed





13. How do Web Workers improve web page performance?
    a) By optimizing CSS rendering
    b) By reducing memory usage
    c) By offloading heavy computations to separate threads
    d) By compressing images before rendering






14. What is the purpose of the `requestAnimationFrame` method?
    a) To request the browser to load external scripts
    b) To schedule a function to execute after the DOMContentLoaded event
    c) To synchronize animations with the browser's rendering cycle
    d) To force the browser to repaint the entire page






15. What is the significance of Web Accessibility (A11y) when working with the DOM?
    a) It ensures compatibility with older web browsers
    b) It enhances SEO optimization
    c) It ensures that the website is accessible to users with disabilities
    d) It improves the loading speed of web pages
