Answer 



01.
The user is logged out and their session data is invalidated.

When a user's session expires in Iron- Session, the user is logged out, and their session data is invalidated. The user will need to log in again to create a new session and access protected areas of the application. This helps maintain the security of the application by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data after a session has expired.







02.
cy.contains()

cy.contains() is used to find an element containing specific text on the page. It can be used to assert that certain text exists within an element.






03.
A testing framework for JavaScript applications

Cypress is a powerful end-to-end testing framework for web applications, including Next.js projects. It allows developers to write tests in JavaScript to interact with web elements and simulate user interactions.







04.
npm start

After building a Next.js application for production using npm run build, the correct command to start the application in production mode is npm start. The start script runs the optimized production build generated during the build process.








05.
npx cypress run

Running npx cypress run executes the Cypress tests in headless mode, meaning it runs the tests without opening the Test Runner interface.








06.
vercel

Vercel (formerly known as ZEIT) is a popular platform for deploying Next.js applications. It provides seamless integration with Next.js, allowing developers to deploy projects easily on Vercel's infrastructure.








07.
By writing a separate JavaScript file and importing it into the test files

To create a custom command in Cypress, you need to write a separate JavaScript file with the desired command logic and then import it into the test files using Cypress.Commands.add().








08.
To visit a website in the browser

cy.visit() is used to navigate to a specific URL (website) in the Cypress Test Runner. It is typically the first command in a test, allowing you to start testing on a specific page.

note [more accurate answer]: To navigate to a specific URL in the application








09.
Lower cost

Serverless deployment of Next.js applications often results in lower costs because it allows developers to pay only for the actual usage of resources. Serverless platforms automatically scale resources based on demand, optimizing cost-efficiency.








10.
By using client-side cookies with encrypted data.

Iron-Session stores session data in client-side cookies with encrypted content. This ensures that session data is secure and cannot be tampered with by the client. The encrypted data is sent back and forth between the client and the server, providing a secure way to manage sessions.






11.
npm install --save-dev cypress

To install Cypress in a Next.js project, you need to use npm install --save-dev cypress to add it as a dev dependency.







12.
Handling user authentication and managing user sessions.

Iron-Session is commonly used in Next.js applications to handle user authentication and manage user sessions. It allows users to log in securely and maintain their session state throughout their interactions with the application.







13 
npm run build

The correct command to build a Next.js project for production deployment is npm run build. This command compiles the Next.js project and creates an optimized production build, ready to be deployed.







14.
By installing the "iron-session" npm package and adding a configuration object.

To use Iron-Session in a Next.js application, you need to install the "iron-session" npm package and import it into your code. You then set up a configuration object with options for the session management, including encryption keys and session expiration settings.








15.
To interact with DOM elements on the page

cy.get() is used to locate and interact with DOM elements on the page, such as clicking buttons, typing into input fields, or asserting their content.
