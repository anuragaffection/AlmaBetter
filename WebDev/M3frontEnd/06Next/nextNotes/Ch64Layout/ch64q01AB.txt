Answer



01.
Server-side rendering support for faster initial page loads.

Emotion.js is a CSS-in-JS library that provides excellent support for server- side rendering in Next.js applications. By rendering styles on the server, Emotion.js helps improve initial page load times and enhances SEO performance.





02.
By naming the file with a .module.css extension.

To enable CSS Modules for a specific CSS file in Next.js, you need to name the file with the .module.css extension. This allows you to use local CSS scope and avoid global conflicts with other CSS styles.







03.]
By using tagged template literals with the styled function.

To scope CSS styles to a specific component in Next.js using styled- components, 
you can use tagged template literals with the styled function. 
This allows you to define unique styles for each component in a way that won't interfere with other components in the application.






04.]
By wrapping the entire JSX content of the page with the styled- jsx/global tag

To apply Global CSS to a Next.js page using the styled-jsx package, you need to wrap the entire JSX content of the page with the styled-jsx/global tag. This will ensure that the CSS rules are applied globally across the page.








05.
Use the style attribute directly on the HTML elements.

To apply inline styles in a Next.js component, you should use the style attribute directly on the HTML elements. 
This allows you to apply styles directly to the element in JSX using JavaScript objects.








06.
CSS Modules are automatically enabled in Next.js without any additional setup.

Next.js has built-in support for CSS Modules, so there is no need for any additional setup or installation. You can use CSS Modules directly by naming your CSS files with the .module.css extension.









07.
By dynamically loading CSS styles only when they are needed.

CSS-in-JS libraries in Next.js can help improve performance by dynamically loading CSS styles only for the components that are actually used in the application. This eliminates the need to load a single large CSS file for the entire application, reducing the overall bundle size and improving loading times.








08.]
<link>

To include an External Stylesheet in a Next.js component, you should use the tag with the rel attribute set to "stylesheet" and the href attribute pointing to the path of the CSS file. This way, the CSS file will be linked to the component.









09.
It causes a build error, and you need to use unique class names.

If you use the same CSS class name in different components, it may cause a class name collision. To avoid this, you should always use unique class names in each component when using CSS Modules.

Using the import statement for CSS files as you would with JavaScript files.

To import and use a CSS Module in a Next.js component, you use the import statement just like you would with JavaScript files. 
Next.js takes care of handling CSS Modules internally.
