Design Evaluation {

    Design Principle
    -- Usability Testing
    -- Heuristics Evaluation]]
    -- Expert Review 
    -- AB Testing 

    Heuristics Principle
    -- Visibility of System Status 
    -- Match between system & real world 
    -- User control & freedom 
    -- Consistency & Standards 
    -- Error Prevention 
    -- Recongnition rather than recall 
    -- flexibility &  efficiency 
    -- aesthetics & minimalist
    -- Recover from error 
    -- Help & documentation 
}


Usability Testing {

    Steps 
    -- create interactive Prototype
    -- share the Prototype
    -- Recruit test participants 
    -- Prepare a test script & Tasks 
    -- setup testing environment 
    -- conduct the Usability test
    -- debrief & collect Feedback
    -- analyze the result 
    -- iterate and refine the design

    Agree or Disagree:
    
    01. Is design evaluation solely focused on assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of a design?
    
    02. One common method used in design evaluation is user testing, where users perform specific tasks to assess the usability of a design.
    
    03. Are usability metrics, such as satisfaction, the only factors considered in evaluating the ease of use and learnability of a design?
    
    04. A heuristic evaluation involves assessing a design based on established principles and guidelines.
    
    05. Is post-test evaluation the only method used to gather feedback from users after they have interacted with a design?

    True or False

    01. Wireframing is the final step in the UI/UX design process.
    
    02. Wireframes are interactive prototypes that allow users to interact with a website or app.
    
    03. Frames can be nested within other frames to create complex layouts and structures.
    
    04. Basic shapes can be used as placeholders during the early design stages to represent more detailed elements.
    
    05. The use of layers in design applications is primarily for aesthetic purposes and does not impact the usability of a design.
    
    06. Design prototypes are primarily created for client presentations and stakeholder meetings.
