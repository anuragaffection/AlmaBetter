Notes {
    -- Notes in (next js app routing )
    -- if we do console in next js , it will not render in browser console ( because of server side rendering )
    -- "use client" = to convert in client side rendering, then console will work on browser

}

01. Next js & React js
--- react js is a library
--- next js is a framework
--- diffrence between library vs framework



02. React js pros (advantage )
--- state (to store data, act like front end batabase )
--- components ( building blocks of code, a class or a function)



03. React js cons (disadvantage)
--- No router (need third party library like - react router dom)
--- On page SEO is impossible 



04. Why should you use Next.js
--- Improved Performance ( SSR, SSG)
--- Automatic routing & zero configuration option 
--- SSR, CSR, dynamic routing, api routes, SASS
--- Serverless deployment, static optimization, caching 




05. CSR vs SSR

-- Client Side Rendering
-- relies on the client's cpu 
-- asynchronous requests to api 
-- client [request to] - server [ response to]  - client.

-- Server Side Rendering
-- server handle initial processing 
-- helps in seo 





06. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
--- on page SEO
--- off page SEO
--- Crawling timing with react only applications
--- Crawling & indexing with next.js




07. Setting Up Next.js project
--- windows powershell 
--- download node 
--- node -v
--- npm -v
--- npx create-next-app my-app
--- cd my-app
--- npm run dev 
--- open http://localhost:3000/

--- scripts in next js {
    dev   = development server 
    build = build file for production 
    start = start the project 
    lint  = suggest error to solve 
}

--- using npm (
    node -v 
    npm -v
    npx create-next-app my-app
    cd my-app
    npm run dev
    npm build
    npm start
)

--- using yarn {
    node -v
    yarn -v
    npx create-next-app my-app
    cd my-app

}








08. React Essentials
--- client components
--- Server components
--- navbar, main, aside [using server], then button within it [using client]
--- 'use client' = boundary between server & client components
--- by default next js follow = server components

--- server components (
    fetch data, 
    backend resources directly, 
    sensitive information, 
    tokens, 
    api keys, 
    large dependencies
)

--- client components (
    event listeners, 
    onClick, onChange etc, 
    state & lifecycle method, 
    useState(), useReducer(), useEffect() etc, 
    browser only api, 
    custom hooks, 
    react class
)





09. Patterns 
--- Moving client components to the leaves
--- Keeping server only code out of client components (Poisoning) (
    - Component poisoning in Next.js refers to the situation where server-side code unintentionally executes on the client-side.
    )
--- npm install server-only

== true

d. React components are only used for static content and cannot handle dynamic data.
== false 

e. Next.js provides built-in optimizations like code splitting, automatic image optimization, and enhancing website performance and user experience.
== true





11. Activity ( fill in the blanks )


a. Next.js can assist with ___________ (off-page SEO/client-side rendering/on-page SEO), which involves optimizing your website or application to make it search engine-friendly.
=== on page seo 


b. For enhanced application performance, it is suggested to place Client Components at the __________ (top/middle/bottom) levels of your component tree whenever feasible.
===  bottom  


c. In Next.js, the "use client" directive is placed at the top of a file, above imports, to define the __________(starting point/cut-off point/transition point) where it crosses the boundary from the server-only to the client part.
=== cut off point
