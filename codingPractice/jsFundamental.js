// 01. 
// difference between .has() && .includes()
// problem number 08 - common element

/*

  In JavaScript, 
  
  the .has() method 
  is used to check if an object has a particular property name. 
  
  The .includes() method 
  is used to check if an array contains a particular value.

//  02. 
// Isomorphic string 

/*
  Two strings are called isomorphic 
  if all occurrences of each character in X can be 
  replaced with another character to get Y and vice-versa. 
  
  In other words, there should be one-to-one mapping 
  for every character of string X to every character of string Y and vice-versa

*/





// 03. 
// example of isomorphic & non isomorphic string 

/*

Here are some examples of isomorphic strings:

"aab" and "xxy"
"ab" and "cd"
"abc" and "def"

Here are some examples of non-isomorphic strings:

"aab" and "xyx"
"ab" and "dc"
"abc" and "defg"
